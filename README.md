# Utility meter

## General idea
In my house I use way to much power (40 MWh per year), and I
wanted to figure out why. On my power meter I have a blinking light that blinks 10 000 times per
kWh. Thus, enter nRF52 with SAADC and some photo
sensitive diodes. The setup is shown below:

![Setup](/graphics/utilitymeter.png)

The general idea is to detect the blinking light with an
photo-sensitive diode, and use a second diode for ambient light
cancellation. The pull-up resistors in the SAADC are used to bias the
diodes, which prevents static current since the pull-up's are
disconnected when SAADC is not sampling.

## Equipment
- nRF52832 DK [PCA 10040](http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Bluetooth-low-energy/nRF52-DK)
- Photo sensitive diode (I'm using
  [TEPT 5600](https://www.elfadistrelec.no/no/sensor-for-omgivelseslys-570-nm-25-140-ua-vishay-tept-5600/p/17522425?channel=b2b&price_afd=4.69&gclid=CjwKCAjwssvPBRBBEiwASFoVd6O3ZSBKCkvYCGIcLTu5Lv50wTM1IL8qSL6yn2cJLDt1JOD39pFJgxoCI1gQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds),
  which is actually a phototransistor, but that's details)

## Algorithm
The best way to understand the algorithm is to read the code, because
it may have changed, but in broad strokes

- Wait for RTC tick
- Sample differential voltage with SAADC
- Check if its a blink
```c
//Remove median value, helps with offset
if(results[0] < min){
    min = results[0];
}
if(results[0] > max){
    max = results[0];
}
results[0] -= (max + min)/2;

//Detected a blink, basically a zero cross detection
last_blink_status = blink_status;
if(results[0] <  0 - adc_hysteresis){
    blink_status = 0;
}else if(results[0] > 0 + adc_hysteresis){
	blink_status = 1;
}
if(last_blink_status ==1 && blink_status == 0){
	blink_counter++;
}
```
- Count blinks over 4 seconds, and calculate the kW
- Transmit an advertizing packet with the kW result embedded in the payload.

## How does it work?
I'm using photo transistors in my setup. The idea in the phototransistor is that the incoming light goes into the base region of the NPN transistor, the light exites the atoms, and make the electrons able to move. You have to provide somewhere for the electrons to go, however, and you do that by connecting the collector to a positiv votlage, and the emitter to ground. Thus, the electrons can freely flow from emitter to collector.

Just a sidenote: quite a while ago they discovered that there was this "current" of charge that flowed when you created a potential difference between two places (battery), and had a metal wire inbetween, but back then they did not know about electrons, thus, they thought the "current" flowed from positive to negative. This is "wrong", but everyone has agreed that current flows from positive to negative, and it's too late to change now. That's the current flows oposite of the electrons.

So, the current goes from collector to emitter. The  principle of a NPN transistor is that if you send a current into the base, it will be able draw a much larger current from the collector. In other words, the light will modulate how much current flows from collector to emitter.

In my setup I use two transistors, because the ambient light will make the same current flow in both the transistors. I "bias" (provide a votlage) with the pull-up resistors. This limits the current that can flow, and thus the voltage is able to change. 

In the end, the blinking will pull more current on one side, and thus the voltage at the input of the SAADC will jump up an down. Note that the SAADC only looks at the difference between the two voltages. It does not care if both go up an down.

## Status
:white_check_mark: Get low power sampling with SAADC working 

:white_check_mark: Add light sensor, and see if I can detect the
blinking from the utility meter 

:white_check_mark: Add low-power beacon based on
https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/solar_sensor_beacon 

:white_check_mark: Setup a nRF52 to capture the packets
https://github.com/wulffern/nrf52-utilitycapture . At this point my
laptop is reading out from the nRF52 capture memory, and plotting the
kWh over a day, but I need to migrate to a Raspberry Pi or similar

:x:  Try it on a Raspberry Pi to use as a gateway

:x: Add nRFCloud functionallity 

## Results (so far)
![Power meter](graphics/power_meter.jpg)
![Result](graphics/result_2017_10.png)


## To run
Ideally it should be

    make
    make SERIAL=<debugger serial> flash 
  
But rarely that will suffice, you probably have to at least change 
SDKPATH in the Makefile

The debugger serial can be found with

	nfjprog -f nrf52 --ids


## Excuses
I'm not a professional embedded programmer (i.e I don't get paid to 
program embedded code), so I'm sorry if you find these examples a bit
messy.

Any concrete criticism/improvment requests are welcome. Send me a
private message on devzone.nordicsemi.com

## Thanks to
- Hans E. for help with the Solar Sensor Beacon Packet format
- HÃ¥kon A., Jon Gunnar S. and the Nordic support team for answering
  questions.
- Martin T. for suggestions on improved advertizer packet

## Disclamer
This is not an official Nordic Semiconductor release, it's examples
I've compiled in my "offline" time.
